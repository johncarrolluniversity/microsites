                <h1>Is there a specific course you took at JCU that you particularly enjoyed?</h1>
                <h2>Looking back, I think my English courses were enjoyable and extremely valuable. No matter what career path a student takes he or she needs to be able to write well. I’m beginning to see how strong communication skills are vital in the sports industry.</h2>

                <h1>What about our Sports Studies program helped prepare you for the next step of a job in the sports industry?</h1>
                <h2> The program is really hands-on with learning. I enjoyed the discussions, speakers, and internship components. The program is geared toward experience, which is awesome because this is definitely an industry you can’t learn from a textbook alone.</h2>

                <h1>Has there been a truly meaningful experience you’ve had at JCU related to Sports Studies?</h1>
                <h2>All of my extracurricular activities made my classroom experiences so much more meaningful because I was able to apply what I was learning. Working in the Sports Information Department taught me how many moving pieces and parts there are behind the scenes of putting on one sporting event. Being President of Carroll Crazies – JCU Athletics’ student spirit club – fostered my leadership skills and creativity with promotions. Working with the Cleveland Indians in the summers throughout college was a phenomenal opportunity and helped me land my current full time job with them just before graduation.</h2>

                <h1>How did JCU help you get your current position?</h1>
                <h2>I honestly believe I wouldn’t be who or where I am today without John Carroll. I discovered my career path by getting involved with the athletic department and working with incredible people. JCU taught me to be passionate and hardworking and I think those two qualities are absolutely necessary for working in sports. </h2>

                <h1>Anything else you’d like to add?</h1>
                <h2>This is a program with Mike Cleary’s amazing legacy and it is set up to succeed. Students need to take advantage of the awesome people and resources available to them through this program. I can’t stress how important it is to get experience and network if you want to work in sports. </h2>
