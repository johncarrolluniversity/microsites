                Perhaps you could say Jake Beiting '06 rounded all the bases before finding his home with the Houston Astros. His experience and enthusiasm on the field, sidelines and classroom ultimately led to his career as the strength and conditioning coach for the MLB team.

                &ldquo;When I was young, I fantasized about being a professional baseball player,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;In high school, I played baseball and football, but a neck injury in my senior year required me to stop.&rdquo;
                <br/><br/>
Beiting joined the Blue Streaks&rsquo; football team, but his injury caused him to miss the first half of his freshman year. To prevent further neck pain, he learned about exercise and injury prevention. The subject fascinated him so much he switched his major to physical education.
				<br/><br/>
During his junior year, with the help of Ron Dolciato, John Carroll&rsquo;s coordinator of physical education and exercise science, he secured an internship with the Cleveland Indians in their weight room. Later, Beiting earned a master&rsquo;s degree in exercise science from the University of South Florida and was promoted to the Indians&rsquo; minor league strength and conditioning coordinator, where he served for five seasons before going to the Astros.
				<br/><br/>
Beiting is proud of the way the exercise science program has grown at JCU. And when he knows of openings in his organization, he looks to Carroll for qualified candidates.
				<br/><br/>
&ldquo;The guy who helped me get my first position in professional sports – Brendan Verner '03 – is now my assistant,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the major league strength and conditioning coach who oversees the Astros&rsquo; minor league system. I try to hire as many JCU grads as possible.&rdquo;
				<br/><br/>
John Carroll alumni provide a national network of opening professional doors for current students.  Many of our alumni are in the front office and coaching positions throughout over 20 teams in the NFL, NCAA administration and coaching and facility management and operations.
