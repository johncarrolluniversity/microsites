                Robert met campus recruiters from a number of companies and accounting firms during several on-campus events hosted by both the Boler School of Business and the Center for Career Services. He eventually landed an internship at Ernst & Young, LLP, for his junior year. During his internship, Robert handled auditing of internal controls, auditing of financials, revenue analytics (does the company meet expectations of revenue), and audits of trusts and investment funds. <br /><br />
At the conclusion of his internship, and more than a year before his graduation, he was offered a full-time position with EY as a financial services auditor. Robert began working for EY shortly after Commencement 2016. As a financial services auditor, he provides assurance for banks, investment firms, and insurance company’s financial statements. <br /><br />
Robert credits the John Carroll experience for preparing him for his future. <br /><br />
“Right from the start I had professors giving advice on how to excel in my career. The accounting program stresses a philosophical understanding of business that helped me adapt to different situations during my internship, which involved revenue analytics and auditing of internal controls. Also, professional counseling in my classes and from my professors and the Career Center helped me do well at my internship. I worked with a fun team of people at EY who explained complex processes in an easy-to-grasp format.”
