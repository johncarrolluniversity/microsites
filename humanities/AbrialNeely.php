					<h1>If you have had an internship, please tell us that story.</h1>
					<h2>I had the opportunity to intern with ABC Good Morning America for the Republican National Convention, which was hosted in Cleveland this summer. I learned about the position through the Political Science Department. It was such an incredible experience because I was able to meet so many people with insider knowledge and learn about both politics and the media.</h2>
                
					<h1>What is your favorite class at JCU so far?</h1>
					<h2>It is so tough to choose a favorite class! However, I would have to go with Communication and the First Amendment because in that course, I learned about communication and how it relates to law; two things that I am passionate about. In this class, we were able to study different Supreme Court cases that involved the press and the First Amendment.</h2>
                
					<h1>What activities and organizations are you involved with on campus?</h1>
					<h2>I am currently the campus editor of The Carroll News, an award-winning student-run newspaper on campus. Writing for the paper has been such a fantastic and rewarding experience. Not only has it improved my writing ability, but it has also prepared me for my future endeavors in journalism. </h2>
                
					<h1>What’s “next” for you?</h1>
					<h2>Although I remain passionate about journalism, political science has taught me a lot about the law, for which I am equally as passionate. Therefore, I have decided to apply to law school. My primary interest is in Public Interest or Civil Rights law. </h2>
                
					<h1>Why should a high school student choose John Carroll?</h1>
					<h2>Aside from being such a welcoming environment, JCU has a plethora of different options for students to choose from, whether it’s academic or extracurricular. In addition, many of the professors are willing to go above and beyond to help students reach their goals.</h2>
                
					<h1>Any advice about the college search in general?</h1>
					<h2>My advice to incoming students would be to explore as many options as possible as early as possible. I also highly recommend studying abroad. I spent a month in London this past summer and grew so much from that experience. I encourage every student to participate in study abroad programs.</h2>
