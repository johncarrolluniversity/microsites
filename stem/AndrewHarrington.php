					<h1>Tell us about how you chose your major.</h1>
					<h2>I knew I was meant to be a biology major when I took the Biodiversity course as part three of the principles of biology series. The course, taught by Dr. Drenovsky, showed me how diverse life on Earth is and how important each phylum is to our existence on this planet. I learned about so many diverse insects, fungi, bacteria, plants, and of course animals. I was familiar with some creatures, and others I had never heard or seen before. The abundant biodiversity on Earth simply fascinated me and it was then I realized I made the correct choice to be a biology major.</h2>

					<h1>Who at JCU have been mentors for you?</h1>
					<h2>Dr. Kyle O’Dell, or just Kyle as he prefers, has been a big influence and mentor for me in my time at JCU and still is to this day. He is the director of the Leadership Scholars Program, of which I am a member, and runs the Leadership Development minor, which I am working toward completing. Within these two programs, I have spent a lot of time with Kyle in and out of the classroom. He is one of the easiest people to talk to and I feel like I can tell him anything. Currently, I am planning my minor capstone project where I will put on a big fundraiser for the Domestic Violence and Child Advocacy Center in Cleveland. He has worked with me through this process and has given me very valuable advice and insight on how I can make this fundraiser happen.</h2>

					<h1>What’s “next” for you?</h1>
					<h2>After graduation, I intend to continue my academic career in graduate school, specifically in Master’s and Ph.D. programs in Bioethics/Healthcare Ethics. I am currently in the process of applying to several schools and researching all about the different programs offered. After graduate school I plan on either teaching at the college level or working as a bioethicist in a hospital by helping counsel families and give expert opinion on tough ethical dilemmas.</h2>

					<h1>What advice do you have for a high school student considering your major/career?</h1>
					<h2>As someone who debated going to medical school for the first part of my college career, keep options like bioethicist, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, etc. open because you can still help a lot of people in these careers, just in a bit of a different capacity. Really take time to learn about yourself and think of major and career options sooner rather than later – once you find your niche, stick with it and you’ll flourish like never before.</h2>

					<h1>Why should a high school student choose John Carroll?</h1>
					<h2>John Carroll provides a rigorous Jesuit academic education that is truly unique compared to many other private colleges and universities. Learning what it means to be Blue Streak and a Jesuit at the same place is something you won’t find anywhere else in the country. With its beautiful campus, small class sizes, amazing faculty and staff, what’s not to love about JCU?</h2>
               
					<h1>Any advice about the college search in general?</h1>
					<h2>Explore all your options and apply to several different schools that are very different from each other (in terms of size, majors offered, religious affiliation, etc.). I would highly encourage visiting the schools you are applying to as many times as possible so you can see the campus in different contexts than an open house or similar event when tons of prospective students are walking around instead of the actual students who go there.</h2>
               
					<h1>Anything this misses?</h1>
					<h2>John Carroll is such a wonderful place that has provided me with amazing opportunities to learn and develop as a student and as an individual. The academics are rigorous, but prepare you for further studies or for the workplace with extreme success. I am so glad that I chose to come to John Carroll and have realized that decision is not just a four year choice, but a forty year choice. I hope that you will make the same great decision to make John Carroll part of your legacy. I did, and I promise that it will be a life-changing experience for you.</h2>
