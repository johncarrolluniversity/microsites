                Iremember sitting in my room during my sophomore year at John Carroll … watching coverage of the &ldquo;Shock &amp; Awe&rdquo; campaign in Iraq that President George W. Bush initiated. The Shock &amp; Awe campaign made me think more seriously about serving my country.
                <br/><br/>
I knew I wanted to be a dentist, which was slightly unusual considering how many times my friends switched majors. During my time at Carroll, I was a shift leader for JCUEMS (John Carroll University Emergency Medical Services). I knew I liked treating patients. My experiences before and during my time at Carroll in observing different dentists in the Cleveland area confirmed my decision. During my senior year, I had to start applying to dental school. The pre-dental program at Carroll and the Pre-Health Professions Society (now Pre-Health Professions Program) helped guide me in the right direction.
				<br/><br/>
As I began the application process, I wanted to look into programs that would lead me to becoming a dentist while in the military. My decision was easy because I had been thinking about military service for years. I wanted to ensure I was accepted into dental school before signing on the dotted line. I wanted to serve, but becoming a dentist was my long-term goal. After getting the much-anticipated letter of acceptance, I applied for the health professions scholarship program through the Army.
				<br/><br/>
After several weeks of waiting, I was notified that I had received the scholarship that would pay for dental school in its entirety. In return, I’d serve four years as an active-duty dentist. 
				<br/><br/>
I graduated from The Ohio State University College of Dentistry in summer 2010. I started active duty in August 2010 at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. After residency training, I was assigned to Fort Drum, New York, as the only dentist for 3,700 soldiers.
				<br/><br/>
John Carroll prepared me well for dental school, which then led me to be successful in my dental career and in the Army. I can’t thank my professors enough for the well rounded and challenging education I was afforded. Carroll provided me not only a great education, but also with the tools that served me after graduation, during dental school, and in Afghanistan.
