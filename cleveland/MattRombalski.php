					<h1>YOUR CLEVELAND EXPERIENCE</h1>
               		<br>
					<h1>How often are you in the city each semester?</h1>
					<h2>At least every other week.</h2>

					<h1>Tell us about your favorite spot(s) in the city.</h1>
					<h2>My favorite spot in the city is the North Coast Harbor. The restaurants have an amazing view of Lake Erie and the buildings around the area are stunning. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Great Lakes Science Center are right there as well and are great places to visit.</h2>
					
					<h1>What&rsquo;s the best restaurant to visit? What&rsquo;s your go-to perfect meal there?</h1>
					<h2>My favorite restaurant is Merwin&rsquo;s Wharf. It is a nicer bar and grill style restaurant right on the Cuyahoga River in the midst of Rivergate Park. The views are amazing and there is often a regatta happening right outside. My favorite meal would be the southern country style chicken or the house burger!</h2>

					<h1>Share a favorite memory/event/experience from your time in Cleveland.</h1>
					<h2>My favorite memory of all time in Cleveland was the recent game 7 of the World Series. Although Cleveland lost, the atmosphere and togetherness in the city was unlike any other; it was absolutely astonishing. There were tens of thousands of people all coming together as one and standing behind not only a team, but the whole city.</h2>
                
					<h1>What are the various ways you take advantage of Cleveland (service, fun, sports, internships)?</h1>
					<h2>The sports in Cleveland have really been on the upward swing and games are becoming so much fun to go to! Also, there are so many companies looking for college students to come and work for them. A lot of them post on John Carroll&rsquo;s career website and they love Carroll students.</h2>
                
					<h1>Overall, JCU helps our students develop intellect, character, leadership, and service in their time on campus. How has Cleveland played a role in these learning goals for you?</h1>
					<h2>Cleveland and all it has to offer have really assisted me in developing intellect, character, and leadership. Whether it be doing service every week, going downtown with friends, or working an internship, everything I have learned and experienced in Cleveland has impacted my John Carroll experience. </h2>
                
					<h1>Why should a local student stay here for college?</h1>
					<h2>Cleveland, more so than a lot of other cities, is constantly changing. Every time I venture into the city I experience or see something new and exciting. People from Cleveland should most especially realize that Cleveland is quickly becoming one of the most amazing cities in the country.</h2>
                
					<h1>Why should a student from farther away come here?</h1>
					<h2>Coming from Boston, I was nervous about coming to Cleveland because I thought it would not have as much to offer as my home city. I was completely wrong. There is actually more to offer me as a college student in Cleveland than there is back in Boston. I go into the city more often, have been offered more jobs and internships, and also have participated in many more leadership and service activities here.</h2>
