					<h1>YOUR CLEVELAND EXPERIENCE</h1>
               		<br>
					<h1>How often are you in the city each semester?</h1>
					<h2>Throughout the week my main focus is on school and extracurricular activities. But on the weekends, I try to explore the city. In addition to my weekend adventures, this past summer I had the experience of working down in Playhouse Square. Working in Playhouse Square afforded me the opportunity to get familiar with the nooks and crannies of Cleveland. From the Asian markets, to the various plays and theaters, to amazing bistro restaurants, I truly fell in love with this city that I now call home. </h2>

					<h1>Tell us about your favorite spot(s) in the city.</h1>
					<h2>I have a unique relationship and understanding of Cleveland that I don&rsquo;t think many people have. Being from Michigan, I love my city of Detroit. And I often find that Cleveland and Detroit get similar bad raps or negative image. But, Cleveland and Detroit have so many amazing things to offer. I have loved exploring Cleveland these past four years, and hope to stay here after graduation. There are two spots in the city that I truly love. First is Public Square. This newly built and renovated outside garden and common area is perfect for anyone—from the busy bankers and businesswomen, to the active mom, to the grandparents that want to stroll around the city. The Square offers water features, outdoor and open seating, stunning greenery, and a plethora of restaurants to choose from. My second favorite part of Cleveland is a town just outside of the city called Chagrin Falls. Chagrin Falls is like a quaint little town out of a movie. From five star restaurants to the beautiful falls, I love strolling the streets of boutiques while eating ice cream from the ice cream parlor. One of the things that makes Cleveland so unique is the numerous opportunities to explore the suburbs outside of the city—from Chagrin Falls, to Shaker Heights, to Coventry, there&rsquo;s a million and one things to do in your backyard. </h2>
					
					<h1>What&rsquo;s the best restaurant to visit? What&rsquo;s your go-to perfect meal there?</h1>
					<h2>I love trying new foods. Studying abroad in China gave me opportunities to try new foods, so I&rsquo;m basically up to try anything fun and new. With this being said, my favorite restaurant to visit is Barrio on East 4th. This is probably a typical answer you would expect from a college student. But their made-to-order tacos are delicious, and their queso is out of this world! The great thing about Barrio is you can order basically anything you want on the menu…so I don&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;go-to&rdquo; meal; instead, I normally mix up what I get each time I visit. </h2>
                
					<h1>What are the various ways you take advantage of Cleveland (service, fun, sports, internships)?</h1>
					<h2>I have been lucky enough to have two different internship experiences in Cleveland. The first was during my sophomore year. I worked as the marketing and events intern at Engage! Cleveland, then located in Playhouse Square. I loved working with the E!C team, promoting Cleveland to natives. This past summer, I worked full time as the marketing intern at Dwellworks, also located in Playhouse Square. I developed truly wonderful working relationships with the marketing team, all while exploring what Cleveland had to offer a young millennial worker.</h2>
                
					<h1>Why should a student from farther away come here?</h1>
					<h2>Being from out of state, I was hesitant to come to a new city. However, the city of Cleveland and its people welcomed me with open arms. No matter where a student is from, he or she will thrive in this city. Attending John Carroll has been the best decision I could&rsquo;ve made so far in my 21 years. Living in University Heights provides a tight-knit community with the city and activities at the tip of your fingers. Come explore Cleveland and see why I now call it my home, and hope to continue to do so.</h2>
