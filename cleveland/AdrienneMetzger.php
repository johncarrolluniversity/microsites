					<h1>YOUR CLEVELAND EXPERIENCE</h1>
               		<br>
					<h1>How often are you in the city each semester?</h1>
					<h2>After working downtown for the summer and experiencing Cleveland firsthand, I have a newfound love for the city. I am in Cleveland several times a month trying out new restaurants, shopping, and even sightseeing around the up-and-coming city.</h2>

					<h1>Tell us about your favorite spot(s) in the city.</h1>
					<h2>I really love East 4th Street along with the Playhouse Square District. They both are beautiful spots downtown with lots to do along with a lot of character. East 4th has many great restaurants including my personal favorite, Mabel&rsquo;s BBQ, whose award-winning BBQ is the best in the city. Playhouse Square is a great place to see one of their many live shows along with being in the heart of Cleveland.</h2>
					
					<h1>What&rsquo;s the best restaurant to visit? What&rsquo;s your go-to perfect meal there?</h1>
					<h2>My favorite restaurant is Barrio. It is a fun, hip restaurant that serves up personalized tacos at low prices. Their shrimp tacos are my personal go-to and I never can go without trying their famous guacamole.</h2>

					<h1>Share a favorite memory/event/experience from your time in Cleveland.</h1>
					<h2>This summer, being in Cleveland for the Cavaliers championship games was by far my favorite memory. I loved seeing the city support the team with such enthusiasm and being a part of the fun and liveliness.</h2>
                
					<h1>What are the various ways you take advantage of Cleveland (service, fun, sports, internships)?</h1>
					<h2>Cleveland is filled with fun and fulfilling opportunities. From cheering on a favorite Cleveland sports team to going to Playhouse Square to watch a live show to eating at one of the many great restaurants Cleveland has to offer, there is never a boring moment to be had. Interning in Downtown Cleveland is a great opportunity to network for a future job and to be around the exciting action happening in the city. The city is filled with many great alumni who are always willing to help a fellow Blue Streak in their field.</h2>
                
					<h1>Overall, JCU helps our students develop intellect, character, leadership, and service in their time on campus. How has Cleveland played a role in these learning goals for you?</h1>
					<h2>My time at JCU has been an experience beyond my wildest dreams and could not have happened without the city of Cleveland. Academics have helped me intellectually but my internship and connections I have made in Cleveland have helped me reach new heights with my leadership skills and nonetheless have helped me grow as a person. The experiences I have had outside the classroom and around Cleveland are experiences I could not have had anywhere else in the country. I am so proud to be part of John Carroll and, even more, part of the city of Cleveland.</h2>
                
					<h1>Why should a local student stay here for college?</h1>
					<h2>There is no better time to be in Cleveland. It is a thriving city with so much to do, not only downtown but all around different parts of the city. There are always things to discover. The city and people at John Carroll make a student feel like they are away from home and on their own, just like going to a school far away. The city has so much to offer and students have endless opportunities throughout their time at John Carroll.</h2>
                
					<h1>Why should a student from farther away come here?</h1>
					<h2>People from far away may not know much about Cleveland, but with a championship-winning basketball team and a baseball team that just went to the World Series, it is hard to miss that we are an up-and-coming city that is growing rapidly. John Carroll students have so many opportunities to become part of the action with internships and service that will advance them in their futures. People in Cleveland are well aware of the small, tight-knit community that John Carroll has, and know what values each student has and stands for. The connections the community has within Cleveland are endless and makes going to John Carroll such an honor.</h2>
