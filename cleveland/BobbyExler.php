					<h1>YOUR CLEVELAND EXPERIENCE</h1>
               		<br>
					<h1>What&rsquo;s the best restaurant to visit? What&rsquo;s your go-to perfect meal there?</h1>
					<h2>Rebol, the location in Public Square is fantastic on a sunny summer day. No.8 Spiced Steak Salad! </h2>

					<h1>Share a favorite memory/event/experience from your time in Cleveland.</h1>
					<h2>I was on East 4th Street with friends from JCU when the Cavs won Game 7 of the NBA Finals. The entire place was going crazy and it was one of the few moments in my life where I felt like I was part of history being made.</h2>
                
					<h1>What are the various ways you take advantage of Cleveland (service, fun, sports, internships)?</h1>
					<h2>I have taken advantage of Cleveland in so many ways over the past four years. My internship was in Public Square this past summer, which game me an incredible day-in and day-out experience of the city. Plus, I have done service with CSSA on the East Side, attended Indians and Cavs games every year I have been at Carroll, and utilized some of the classically Cleveland spots like the West Side Market. </h2>
                
					<h1>Overall, JCU helps our students develop intellect, character, leadership, and service in their time on campus. How has Cleveland played a role in these learning goals for you?</h1>
					<h2>Cleveland played a crucial role in my development of these learning goals by giving me frontiers to apply the knowledge I learned in a context that was more than I ever anticipated I would. The first one that comes to mind was my service experience with Lutheran Metropolitan Ministries my sophomore year. I was in a business communications class with a service-learning component, which allowed me the opportunity to share the knowledge I had developed in the classroom with individuals looking to get back on their feet and find a job. It was an incredible opportunity to not only feel like my intellect was having a positive impact on my community, but also that I was growing in character and leadership as I served these people. </h2>
                
					<h1>Why should a local student stay here for college?</h1>
					<h2>I firmly believe that the John Carroll experience allows you to see Cleveland from so many different perspectives that, regardless of whether you are from near or far, the city truly has something to offer you. Whether you are interested in the arts, sports, or helping those in need, Cleveland will offer you experiences that you will take with you for the rest of your life.</h2>
